                    <h1>Soon - RoDuo Malibu</h1>
                    <p>RoDuo Malibu isn't released yet, because we are having some issues. We are currently working with that issues to be fixed. These troubles are connected with Edge Store AddOns, because somehow extensions get failure. We forgot to note that it is working only with <b>dark mode</b>. So you may have more issues with that, if you're white theme lover (I don't know if there are people that like white theme). We are thankful for your patience. This is, RoDuo.</p>

                    <h1>RoDuo Visalia</h1>
                    <p>RoDuo Malibu isn't last version of RoDuo, heh. We are working on something recoded, better, RoDuo Visalia. Fully redesigned Roblox with OLED Theme (Experimental). Maybe, full redesigned navigation menu? Or something about full redesigned pages, to make everything <i>better.</i> This version isn't public to everyone, because it is not developed yet. Check developments channel in our Discord Server for public leaks or new features.</p>

                    <h1>RoDuo Monterey</h1>
                    <p>Monterey version, is a special version which can change RoDuo forever. With the new Roblox features, that Roblox itself are lazy to make them, because why do they need it? This is next generation of RoDuo recoding (*again) to make it better and get more attention for users. It may be even better than next version. More information can be posted soon, as RoDuo Monterey isn't developing at this moment, after Visalia version. So you may join to the Discord server to get leaks about all the versions which will be developed in the future! :)</p>

                    <p>We do a little trolling with the all versions, which are will be in the public. You better disable RoDuo in the 1st April, because it'll be API Trolling day, funny.</p>
